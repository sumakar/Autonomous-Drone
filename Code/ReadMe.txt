This folder contains all the codes that were used to acheive the autonomous behaviour of the quadcopter.
NOTE: Every code has a Arming and Disarming sequence with a failsafe system by which even if the quadcopter goes out of control pressing CTRL-C, the quadcopter automatically goes into landing mode or reduce throttle or disarm, depending on the code we have those features.

You should also have UART connection between APM and Raspberry-Pi. Refer tutorial folder for this setup.
